# Wordle Game in Java

This project is a fully functional Wordle game implemented in Java. The game challenges players to guess a five-letter word within a limited number of attempts. It includes the following key features:

- **Color Codes**: Visual feedback is provided through color codes to indicate whether a guessed letter is correct and in the correct position, correct but in the wrong position, or incorrect entirely.
- **Multiple Classes**: The game is structured using multiple classes to separate concerns such as game logic, word handling, and user interaction.
- **File Reading**: The game reads word lists from external files, allowing for easy updates or customization of the word pool without modifying the source code.

The game runs in the console and provides an engaging Wordle experience with dynamic feedback and clean code organization.
